# 📝 TODo - Modern To-Do List App

A beautiful and functional to-do list web application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## 🌟 What We Built

This is a simple but elegant task management app where you can:
- ✅ Add new tasks
- ✅ Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- ✅ Delete tasks you don't need
- ✅ Filter tasks (All, Active, Completed)
- ✅ See task statistics
- ✅ Clear all completed tasks at once

### Features Explained

**Statistics Bar**: Shows you three numbers:
- Total: All your tasks
- Active: Tasks you haven't completed yet
- Completed: Tasks you've finished

**Time Stamps**: Each task shows when it was created (e.g., "2m ago", "5h ago")

**Clear Completed**: When you have finished tasks, you can remove them all at once
